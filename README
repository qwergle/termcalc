My Capstone (GCalc)
Hello! This README serves as instructions for using and building this. Everything is intended to be accessed via the shell script gcalc.sh.

BUILDING
The commands used in building this are in Makefile. Simply type make in order to build it and type clean to remove the executable and shared library built by make.

USE
Run gcalc.sh. If run with one or more arguments, it will not allow the user to close the script. This is so that users cannot easily gain access to the shell during demonstration. If run with zero arguments, it will allow users to quit. gcalc.sh is also intended for use with Bash.

LIMITATIONS
This calculator supports all PEMDAS operations, the use of x, pi and e, and the use of sine and cosine. Nothing else. Also, this is specifically designed for Unix-like systems. It will work on MacOS and Linux, but it will not function on Windows without alterations to the source code.
