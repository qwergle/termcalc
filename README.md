# termcalc

`termcalc` is a mostly functional command-line calculator.

## Use

Use `termcalc -h` or `termcalc --help` for a list of acceptable arguments. Interactive mode launches an interpreter and graphing mode launches a graphing calculator.

## Building

Just run `make`. Please note that the makefile, along with the rest of this program, was created on a MacBook, so while it will likely work in OSX, it might not work on some Linux systems and almost certainly won't work on Windows. If it doesn't work for you, create a GitHub issue.
